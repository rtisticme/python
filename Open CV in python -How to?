Installing OpenCV on Windows
1. Open the command line and type: (run as administrator)

pip install opencv-python 

2. Then open a Python session and try:

import cv2 

3. If you get no errors, then OpenCV has been successfully installed and you can skip the next steps. 

4. If there is an error (usually saying that DLL load failed) then please download a precompiled wheel 
(.whl) file from (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv)
and install it with pip.
Make sure you download the correct file for your Windows version and your Python version. 
For example, for Python 3.6 on Windows 64-bit you would do this:

pip install opencv_python‑3.2.0‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl 

5. Then try to import cv2 in Python again. If there's still an error, then please type the following again in the command line:

pip install opencv-python 

6. Now you should successfully import cv2 in Python.
