#this program says hello and asks for my name

print ('hello world!')

print ('What is your name') #ask for name
myName=input() #takes the value in myName 
print('it is good to meet you, ' + myName)
print('the length of your name is:')
print(len(myName)) #length of string

print('what is your age?') #ask for age
myAge= input()
print('you will be ' + str(int(myAge)+1)+' in a year'  ) #we covert the integer value to string because the final value is in string


#the intiger value and string value cannot be added together
like ('26') #string +5 #int 
gives an error 
so the code need to be converted to same types
like int('26') #string converted to integer +5 #int
which gives an output of 31

#input() always takes a string value
